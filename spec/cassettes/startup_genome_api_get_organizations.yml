The business was originally part of an publicly-listed enterprise software supplier to government; BasicGov was taken private in September 2010. BasicGov has 34 cities and counties as customers and was recently selected by a US state to supply a surface land management solution. The company is growing organically at almost 100% per year.<br \/><br \/>BasicGov is offered in partnership with Salesforce.com and delivered over the web as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or a Cloud Computing application. BasicGov was designed for governments who need to cut costs while managing business functions like permitting and inspections, code enforcement, planning, land management and licensing. Unlike enterprise software that is expensive to acquire and difficult to implement, BasicGov requires no capital investment and is quick to set up. BasicGov costs at least 30% less than legacy solutions.<br \/><br \/>The Problem<br \/><br \/>All levels of government across the United States and Canada are under pressure to become more efficient while they deliver quality services to citizens, however, they face the following key problems:<br \/><br \/><ul><br \/><br \/><li>Limited staff and constrained budgets.<\/li><br \/><br \/><li>Traditional IT approaches fail to meet the changing needs of cities, counties and states.<\/li><br \/><br \/><li>Enterprise solutions are too expensive and slow to install while Windows software falls short of<br \/><br \/>today?s standards for reliability, support and security.<\/li><br \/><br \/><\/ul><br \/><br \/>The Solution<br \/><br \/>BasicGov is a suite of web-based software that includes: Permits &amp; Inspections, Code Enforcement, Licensing, Planning and a Citizen Portal. The web-based software allows cities, counties, government agencies and states to improve productivity and provide better services to citizens by streamlining and automating processes in land management, community and economic development for sustainable growth. BasicGov integrates parcel-based records graphically with GIS databases. BasicGov is used by government managers, inspectors and staff to streamline the process of issuing licenses and permits, scheduling inspections, enforcing codes, tracking complaints and managing planning processes.","joinUrl":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/organizations\/join\/basicgov-systems","hiringUrl":"","founded":null,"investments_received":[]},{"type":"organization","url":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/bitmain-studios-inc","slug":"bitmain-studios-inc","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/startupgenome-avatars\/organizations\/bitmain-studios-inc.png","investments_made":[],"addresses":[{"line1":"W 4th Ave","line2":null,"postal_code":null,"location":{"name":"Vancouver","url":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/vancouver-britishcolumbia-can","slug":"vancouver-britishcolumbia-can","abbreviation":null,"full_name":"Vancouver, British Columbia, CAN","type":"city","parent":"britishcolumbia-can","latitude":"49.2612305","longitude":"-123.1139297"},"latitude":"49.2685089","longitude":"-123.1776810","formatted":"W 4th Ave, Vancouver, British Columbia, CAN","primary":false}],"categories":[{"plural_name":"Startups","singular_name":"Startup","slug":"startups"}],"industries":[],"name":"Bitmain Studios Inc.","employees":"1","description":"Bitmain Studios Inc Web Application Development startup founded in April 2009.<br \/><br \/>Bitmain&#8217;s motto is &#8220;building simple, useful, beautiful web apps.&#8221;<br \/><br \/>Bitmain Studios operates out of beautiful Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.","joinUrl":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/organizations\/join\/bitmain-studios-inc","hiringUrl":"","founded":null,"investments_received":[]},{"type":"organization","url":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/bits-republic-technologies","slug":"bits-republic-technologies","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/startupgenome-avatars\/organizations\/bits-republic-technologies.png","investments_made":[],"addresses":[{"line1":"1155 W Pender St","line2":null,"postal_code":"V6E","location":{"name":"Vancouver","url":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/vancouver-britishcolumbia-can","slug":"vancouver-britishcolumbia-can","abbreviation":null,"full_name":"Vancouver, British Columbia, CAN","type":"city","parent":"britishcolumbia-can","latitude":"49.2612305","longitude":"-123.1139297"},"latitude":"49.2881279","longitude":"-123.1217880","formatted":"1155 W Pender St, Vancouver, British Columbia, CAN","primary":false}],"categories":[{"plural_name":"Startups","singular_name":"Startup","slug":"startups"}],"industries":[],"name":"Bits Republic Technologies","employees":0,"description":"Bits Republic Technologies, Inc. has developed My Own Bits?

Unable to find an online accounting solution that was everything the budding entrepreneurs required, the idea behind Kashoo was born.<br \/><br \/>Over the next 14 months, the Vandermeer?s built the first online accounting software aimed at helping small businesses organize and manage their finances. Unlike other desktop accounting applications, Kashoo was built from the ground up to leverage cloud computing and enable collaboration, mobility, data sharing, and above all, simplicity and peace of mind by knowing your records are always secure and up to date.<br \/><br \/>Within months of introducing the site, the application attracted small businesses from around the world and a number of investment and acquisition offers. In the summer of 2009, Canada?s largest small business tax preparation and planning firm, FBC discovered the site and became a strategic investor with the intent of offering Kashoo to their 50,000 small business clients in Canada.<br \/><br \/>Along the way, the founders of FBC recognized the timeliness and potential of Kashoo beyond their customer base and pledged financing and resources to launch Kashoo into the US and international markets. In October 2009, Jim Secord was recruited as CEO to grow Kashoo into a leader in the online accounting market for small businesses.<br \/><br \/>Prior to joining Kashoo, Jim spent 12 years in the online real estate space and launched the leading online MLS (Multiple Listing Service) system which is in use by over 60% of the real estate professionals in North America. In 2006, Jim founded Kurio, the first smart phone application for REALTORS and consumers. Kurio is now the leading mobile application in real estate with over 50,000 paid subscribers and is marketed through CoreLogic. Jim was named as one of the top 100 influential leaders in real estate technology by Inman news, the leading real estate industry publication, and is a recognized leader in SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions.<br \/><br \/>Kashoo, based in Vancouver, Canada, is funded by private investment from FBC and has a number of distribution deals with financial and accounting firms to market Kashoo. The application has several thousand subscribers and is used in over 50 countries.
