Unlike other desktop accounting applications, Kashoo was built from the ground up to leverage cloud computing and enable collaboration, mobility, data sharing, and above all, simplicity and peace of mind by knowing your records are always secure and up to date.<br \/><br \/>Within months of introducing the site, the application attracted small businesses from around the world and a number of investment and acquisition offers. In the summer of 2009, Canada?s largest small business tax preparation and planning firm, FBC discovered the site and became a strategic investor with the intent of offering Kashoo to their 50,000 small business clients in Canada.<br \/><br \/>Along the way, the founders of FBC recognized the timeliness and potential of Kashoo beyond their customer base and pledged financing and resources to launch Kashoo into the US and international markets. In October 2009, Jim Secord was recruited as CEO to grow Kashoo into a leader in the online accounting market for small businesses.<br \/><br \/>Prior to joining Kashoo, Jim spent 12 years in the online real estate space and launched the leading online MLS (Multiple Listing Service) system which is in use by over 60% of the real estate professionals in North America. In 2006, Jim founded Kurio, the first smart phone application for REALTORS and consumers. Kurio is now the leading mobile application in real estate with over 50,000 paid subscribers and is marketed through CoreLogic. Jim was named as one of the top 100 influential leaders in real estate technology by Inman news, the leading real estate industry publication, and is a recognized leader in SaaS (Software as a Service) solutions.<br \/><br \/>Kashoo, based in Vancouver, Canada, is funded by private investment from FBC and has a number of distribution deals with financial and accounting firms to market Kashoo.

Want to save money but not be embarrassed by use\/redemption<br \/><br \/>        b.  Desire discounts when and where they want them<br \/><br \/>c)  LAAs <br \/><br \/>        a.  Have consumers but are searching for ways to monetize them easily<br \/><br \/>        b.  Users interact, play or check in primarily at restaurants. <br \/><br \/>The North American restaurant market is worth $350 billion with one million restaurants, driven by an estimated $14 billion marketing spend. Storm has been able to prove that this is a profitable and growing market through its LetsGoForDinner.com consumer brand.  It generates $34.00 in annual revenue per member with an upfront cost of $9.00.  In a third of the cases this cost is self-funding from the $15.00 annual membership.  <br \/><br \/>LetsGoForDinner.com is piloting different rollout methods with bloggers and freelancers in order to drive down customer and restaurant acquisition costs. They will be combined with a new iPhone application and immediate digital acquisition solutions to increase revenue. With this model, Storm has a clearly competitive and different value proposition when compared to Restaurant.com, The Entertainment Book and other media (Yellow Pages, newspapers, TV and radio) that restaurants use. <br \/><br \/>With minimal startup capital, the company has grown its consumer base and still has managed to introduce new products (preload, gift memberships\/certificates and iPhone to be launched), acquire new restaurants (now at 30) and customers (4000 signed).","founded":null,"size":"2-10","hiring_url":"","active":"1","approved":"1","slug":"storm-media-innovations-inc","organization_id":"200951","url":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/storm-media-innovations-inc","categories":[{"category_id":2,"plural_name":"Startups","singular_name":"Startup","slug":"startups"}],"latitude":"49.2824593","longitude":"-123.1092224","zip":null,"address1":"163 W Hastings St","address2":null,"state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada"},"201185":{"id":"201185","name":"Strutta","headline":"","description":"Strutta is a technology company that helps brands connect with consumers through social media promotions and is a Facebook Preferred Developer Consultant.

Essentially, it puts the best features of Google Gmail ? and much more ? into the most popular email management client used in business today. <br \/><br \/>Taglocity 2.0 for Outlook enables users to assign unlimited keyword ?tags? to any MS Outlook items such as email, contacts, calendar entries, etc. This helps create an organizational system better adapted to business use.  For instance, instead of forcing content into conventional folder structures that are far too rigid and often redundant or ambiguous,  each tag essentially acts as a virtual folder, thus reducing the need for folder hierarchies altogether. So instead of making copies of an email to put in several different folders, users can simply set multiple tags on the original message ? and later, can quickly find that email with dynamic filtering or a simple tag search. <br \/><br \/>Tags also provide additional context to keyword searches which improves the relevancy of search results.  With Taglocity?s intelligent search pruning feature, users spend less time wading through huge volumes of keyword generated search results to quickly find what they are looking for.<br \/><br \/>To help improve organizational efficiency, Taglocity can also automate common tasks by running actions when tags are set, such as turning email into appointments or tasks, assigning additional tags, or simply moving messages into specified folders.  Tags can be automatically assigned to incoming email based on user specified criteria such as who the message is from, or containing certain words in the message body, etc.  <br \/><br \/>Taglocity tags are either private or public.  Public tags travel with messages to extend the benefit of tagging to others and also ?round trip? so that reply messages come back pre-tagged, even if the other recipients are not Taglocity users.   Another time saving feature with Taglocity is tag bundling.  Tags that are commonly used together are presented as suggestions so that multiple tags can be assigned with a single click or keystroke.<br \/><br \/>Taglocity 2.0 for Outlook also delivers another popular Gmail feature to Outlook: proper conversation viewing.  A single mouse click brings up all related emails in a single viewer in chronological order similar to a blog.   Attachment handling with Taglocity 2.0 for Outlook is more contact-centric than before, and attachments are also much easier to find.<br \/><br \/>COMING SOON ? Taglocity Groups<br \/><br \/>Taglocity Groups is an online (or intranet-based) secure repository where email can be posted for others to see and collaborate on  (think del.icio.us but for your teams email).<br \/><br \/>Taglocity Groups serves two main purposes:  minimize email overload by significantly reducing inbox bloating ?office spam? (?Reply All? abuse and needless CC?s); and reveal and share valuable business information which is typically locked up on the desktops of authors and original recipients.  Group members voluntarily publish email to their Taglocity Groups with any email client, and can then access shared group emails from any Web browser or directly with Taglocity 2.0 for Outlook. To join the free public Taglocity Groups beta, visit https:\/\/groups.taglocity.com\/Login\/CreateAccount.aspx.  <br \/><br \/>Also soon to come, a Taglocity client that works with Gmail\/Yahoo and Live\/Hotmail.<br \/><br \/>To sum it up, Taglocity 2.0 is an Enterprise Web 2.0 inspired email productivity and knowledge sharig solution for enterprises. It really is simple-to-use yet very powerful - and it?s enthusiastically adopted by users because it provides personal value and works within an environment they already use every day.","founded":"1168408800","size":null,"hiring_url":"","active":"1","approved":"1","slug":"taglocity","organization_id":"202448","url":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/taglocity","categories":[{"category_id":2,"plural_name":"Startups","singular_name":"Startup","slug":"startups"}],"latitude":"49.2811203","longitude":"-123.1045074","zip":null,"address1":"425 Carrall St","address2":"Suite 220","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada"},"202617":{"id":"202617","name":"ShareDesk","headline":"","description":"Sharedesk is an online marketplace for shared workspaces.<br \/>\r\nWe provide a platform that allows mobile workers, business travelers, and entrepreneurs to discover shared workspaces and book them under flexible terms.","founded":"1322697600","size":null,"hiring_url":"","active":"1","approved":"1","slug":"sharedesk","organization_id":"202617","url":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/sharedesk","categories":[{"category_id":2,"plural_name":"Startups","singular_name":"Startup","slug":"startups"}],"latitude":"49.2837105","longitude":"-123.1192474","zip":null,"address1":"885 W Georgia St","address2":null,"state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada"},"202819":{"id":"202819","name":"Tasktop","headline":"","description":"Tasktop Technologies is the creator of the Eclipse Mylyn task management platform for application lifecycle management (ALM).

Using Wantsa?s platform, these companies introduce a full suite of highly profitable and significant revenue streams and deliver exactly what their consumer audience and business advertisers WANT.<br \/><br \/>For local advertisers that meant creating a system that could deliver: sales, leads, consumer feedback and repeat business to any local merchant on a ?Pay Per Result? basis.<br \/><br \/>For consumers, delivering what they wanted was as easy as giving them great deals and discounts on the things they were looking for and connecting them to compaines that were recommended by their friends and collegues.<br \/><br \/>Wantsa?s platform can be licenced by any Newspaper, Directory Company, or major Search companies to deliver the results their advertisers and consumers are looking for.<br \/><br \/>Wantsa?s techology, methodology, and sales training systems allow these organizations to transition quickly and efficiently into selling new and powerful products that allow them to remain competitive and dramatically increase revenue.","founded":null,"size":null,"hiring_url":"","active":"1","approved":"1","slug":"wantsa","organization_id":"211101","url":"http:\/\/startupgenome.co\/wantsa","categories":[{"category_id":2,"plural_name":"Startups","singular_name":"Startup","slug":"startups"}],"latitude":"49.2867508","longitude":"-123.1227722","zip":null,"address1":"1100 Melville St","address2":"Suite 380","state":"British Columbia","country":"Canada"},"211815":{"id":"211815","name":"Weddingful","headline":"","description":"\u2665 A social wedding community that connects brides-to-be with local vendors to plan their weddings with ease.
