# Startup HealthCheck

Startup HealthCheck is an open source project designed to power data collection and aggregation for local startup communities. The goal is to gather data around companies, people, events, and jobs.

## StartupGenome

The core of HealthCheck's backend curation around startup company data is powered by the StartupGenome API. We are working with Shane and the StartupGenome team to be a great stand alone client for SG, while also enabling gathering of extra data. In turn, SG provides bulk upload via CSV, map-based visualization, and integration / sync with Crunchbase, Angel List, and others.

## Goals

* turnkey hosting - easy for any community to install their own instance (e.g. Heroku / static web site / etc.)
* brandable - customize with your own community brand & design
* aggregation - limited "original content" creation; aggregation of title + link + limited other metadata for events and jobs -- i.e. not a blogging or content creation platform
* open data - connectivity and re-use of StartupGenome API, plugins for Salesforce, default license that makes data shareable by default
