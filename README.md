# Startup HealthCheck

Startup HealthCheck is an open source project designed to power data collection and aggregation for local startup communities.

## StartupGenome

The core of HealthCheck's backend curation around startup company data is powered by the StartupGenome API. We are working with Shane and the StartupGenome team to be a great stand alone client for SG, while also enabling gathering of extra data. In turn, SG provides bulk upload via CSV, map-based visualization, and integration / sync with Crunchbase, Angel List, and others.
